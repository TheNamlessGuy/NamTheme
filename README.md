# NamTheme
A Firefox theme

Heavily inspired by the [Synthwave 84 theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/synthwave-84/) by [Crombopoulous Michelle](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/user/16210659/)

## Get
### Manual download

Drag and drop the file into your Firefox instance to install it.

### From Firefox AMO

## How to edit
In order to make it easier (for me, at least) to edit, I made it so you edit `manifest.template.json` and then run the `generate.py` script in order to generate the `manifest.json` that the browser needs.
